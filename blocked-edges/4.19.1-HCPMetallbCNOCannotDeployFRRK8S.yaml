message: |-
  On Hosted Control Plane (HCP/HyperShift) clusters with installed MetalLB operator, Cluster Network Operator fails to
  deploy a critical component FRR-k8s when updated. MetalLB will stop working properly and stop advertising services,
  making them potentially unreachable from outside the cluster.
